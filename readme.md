A Developer's Best Friend is a dynamic PHP-based website application used to generate random data.

<b>Lorem Ipsum Generator:</b>
Building on a classic, this Lorem Ipsum generator allows the user to specify the number of paragraphs needed as well as the option to generate Lorem Ipsum text according to text case. Options include <u>S</u>entence case, UPPERCASE, and lowercase text- <u>S</u>entence case being the default.

<b>User Generator:</b>
The user generator allows the user to input the number of random user profiles they would like to generator as well as options to include a phone number, location, career, and a favorite quote(generated by Lorem Ipsum). The user is given the option to generator profiles by gender and resulting profiles include an image.

<b>Password Generator:</b>
Based off the xkcd password generator, this application allows the user to generator a random password determined by the number of words they would like to use as well as symbols and even an number option. Most of the logic is derived from the p2 project(www.p2.yanfchen.me) done previously and then transformed into a Laravel project.
